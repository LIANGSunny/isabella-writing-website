    I nodded to answer her; I walked on stage on my tiptoes. The light shined brightly on me, I felt my family and teacher encouraging me to do my best in my heart.  I listened to the music, and my body slowly started to follow it without me knowing. I thought it was going to go terribly bad. But it appeared better without me even trying to make it my best.  My movements were just natural, my body didn’t need me to direct it, it just followed the music. When I finished, I heard clapping, the clapping was like a bunch of horses running across the vast grass world. When I heard the clapping, I thought it was over. But I remember my teacher saying bow after you finish, and to the audience, even though the other students did not. That shows respect to them after they helped judged the instruction and bowed then said thank you. I suddenly heard one person clapping again then somebody followed then whole room burst into clapping of thunder. Even the judges’ faces all appeared with smiles. I studded of stage with pride. My teacher hugged me with tears and whispered to me that she never thought I would follow her instructions. I hugged her back thanking her that she told me about it. Then, my teacher finally told the truth that now I am on TV. I sighed with exaggeration but said nothing. I went to get my trophy; I actually got gold! My teacher turned around and landed me her own trophy and saw that this was real gold and saw that this was real gold not fake gold. I snatched a magnifying glass from the table and examined it five times more to make sure I was right. We took a group picture with my teacher because this was the last time to see it was snowing then I saw my reflection in the trophy. This trophy was like a Christmas gift to me. It was like a gift from the gods. I prayed that we could get to play outside and write this event down in my diary. From now on, I was never scared of any competition. We thanked my teacher which I won’t tell you her name, ok, ok, I’ll tell you, her name is called “Ms.Li.” I thanked her with all my might to tell how I appreciate the things she did all for me. 

	Today was an exhausting day but taught me a lot of things that I would need when I grow up. Today I learned to be confident, learned to appreciate others……(which means that I learnt lot more) But most importantly I learned to show kindness because kindness is always the key!
